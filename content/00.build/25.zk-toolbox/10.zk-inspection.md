description: Create and manage ZK Stack with ZK Inspection
---

ZK Inception is a tool that facilitates the creation and management of ZK Stacks. It provides a set of interactive commands that can also accept arguments via the command line.

### Prerequisites

Before using ZK Inception, ensure you have set up the necessary dependencies on your machine. Follow the [setup instructions](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/blob/main/docs/guides/setup-dev.md), but you can skip the Environment section for now.

### Foundry Integration

ZK Inception uses Foundry for deploying smart contracts. You can pass Foundry integration flags using the `-a` option. For example:

```bash
zk_inception -a --gas-estimate-multiplier=500
```


### Ecosystem Management

ZK Stack allows you to create a new ecosystem or connect to an existing one. An ecosystem includes components like the BridgeHub, shared bridges, and state transition managers.

#### Creating an Ecosystem

To create a ZK Stack project, start by creating an ecosystem:

```bash
zk_inception ecosystem create
```

#### Initializing an Ecosystem

If the ecosystem has never been deployed before, initialize it:

```bash
zk_inception ecosystem init
```

For default parameters, use:

```bash
zk_inception ecosystem init --dev
```

#### Changing the Default Chain

To change the default ZK chain:

```bash
zk_inception ecosystem change-default-chain
```

#### Setting Up Observability

To set up [era-observability](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-observability):

```bash
zk_inception ecosystem setup-observability
```


### ZK Chain Management

#### Creating a New Chain

Create additional chains and switch between them:

```bash
zk_inception chain create
```

#### Initializing a Chain

Deploy contracts and initialize a ZK Chain:

```bash
zk_inception chain init
```

### Running the ZK Server

To run the chain:

```bash
zk_inception server
```

### Prover Management

#### Initializing the Prover

To initialize the prover and prepare it for generating proofs:

```bash
zk_inception prover init
```

#### Generating Setup Keys

Generate the setup keys necessary for proving operations:

```bash
zk_inception prover generate-sk
```

#### Running the Prover

Start the prover to begin generating proofs for the network:

```bash
zk_inception prover run
```

### Contract Verifier

#### Initializing the Contract Verifier

Initialize the contract verifier to start verifying proofs:

```bash
zk_inception contract-verifier init
```

#### Running the Contract Verifier

Run the contract verifier to validate proofs and ensure contract correctness:

```bash
zk_inception contract-verifier run
```

### External Node Management

#### Preparing Configs

Generate and prepare the necessary configurations for the external node:

```bash
zk_inception en configs
```

#### Initializing the External Node

Initialize the external node before starting it on the network:

```bash
zk_inception en init
```

#### Running the External Node

Run the external node to participate in the network:

```bash
zk_inception en run
```

### Portal and Explorer

#### Running the Portal

Run the portal to interact with the ZKsync network:

```bash
zk_inception portal
```

#### Initializing the Explorer

Initialize the explorer to monitor and track network activity:

```bash
zk_inception explorer init
```

#### Running the Explorer Backend

Start the backend service of the explorer for a specific chain:

```bash
zk_inception explorer backend --chain <chain_name>
```

#### Running the Explorer Frontend

Run the frontend service of the explorer to provide a user interface:

```bash
zk_inception explorer run
```

### Updating the Node

To update your node with the latest changes:

```bash
zk_inception update
```
